Rudolph Group Matlab Environment

This repository contains the MATLAB environment that we use. It contains some of our own routines, but mostly routines from other people, including many scripts and functions from the MathWorks MATLAB file exchange. Each subfolder's readme file contains information about the provenance and licensing of the software therein.
